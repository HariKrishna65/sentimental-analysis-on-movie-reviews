Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker is one of the greatest performances in cinematic history. Ledger completely disappears into the role and creates a character that is both terrifying and fascinating. The Dark Knight is a masterpiece of storytelling and filmmaking, and Ledger's Joker is a big part of what makes it so great. Christopher Nolan's direction is impeccable, and the screenplay is smart and engaging. The Dark Knight is not just a great superhero movie; it's a great movie, period.

I remember watching The Dark Knight in theaters when it first came out, and it completely blew my mind. The story, the acting, the action, everything about it was just incredible. Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker is one of the best performances I've ever seen, and it's a tragedy that he's no longer with us. The Dark Knight is not just a great superhero movie; it's a great movie, period. Christopher Nolan did an amazing job directing it, and it's a film that will be remembered for a long time.

The story, from opening credits to final scene.
"An average portrayal of a historical event, missing the opportunity to delve deeper into its significance."
This film is one of the reasons I hate the Oscars.
"If it seems like a minor miracle that it's septuagenarian star is young enough to be the nonagenarian filmmaker's son, more incredible still are the clear-eyed boldness and quiet irony with which actor and director take on life's urgent questions."

Heath Ledger as the Joker is brilliant, and anytime he's on the screen this action film seems elevated. It also gets the nihilistic insanity of the character right, as Alfred (Michael Caine) so correctly puts it, "Some men just want to watch the world burn." I was less of a fan of Christian Bale's performance as Batman, with his toneless, gruff voice, and if I'm honest, even the concept of the Dark Knight, with Batman sans Robin viewed as an evil vigilante by the citizens of Gotham. I also thought the film tried to pack too much in, with the love interest/triangle (Maggie Gyllenhaal), rise of Two-Face (Aaron Eckhart), and extraneous characters (e.g., Morgan Freeman). It could have also used a breather in between all the action scenes, though some of the elements, like that batpod with the extra fat tires, were pretty cool. It goes on way too long at 152 minutes, and if it had been pared down and more focused on the Joker, I think it could have been a lot better. At the end of the day, it's a well-executed, dark action film with a solid cast, good direction, and a stand-out performance by Ledger, but it's just not the best thing ever made.
"A captivating cross-cultural comedy of manners."
"It's a revelation, a film that will challenge your preconceptions and leave you thinking long after it's over."
Dark, yes, complex, ambitious. Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. "The Dark Knight" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger, and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelops Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind-blowing, and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he's done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakespearean proportions. Bravo!

As for Heath, yes, he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It's not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker's stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being makes the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character, and only a perfect performance could've pulled something like this off. That's how difficult of a role this was, and that's why Ledger's performance is so great.

Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is what everyone remembers from this film, and it is truly a stunning performance. I also liked Christian Bale as Batman, and the two have great chemistry.

Overall, though, it's a great film that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys a good action thriller.

Smith delivers yet another popcorn blockbuster and does his usual cocky performance that we've seen so many times - the only thing that stops him getting irritating is that he is clearly out of his depth in K's world. Tommy Lee Jones is very good and in my mind, a lot cooler than Smith, he does get some good deadpan lines but mainly is Smith's straight man. It's hard to imagine anyone else doing the role as he does it so well and I hope they manage to twist the sequel to bring his character back in - I can't image Smith can carry MIB2. Fiorentino, D'Onofrio, Shalhoub and Rip Torn all add class in support but this is mainly Smith and Jones's show.

I couldn't believe "The Dark Knight" could live up to the hype. That's perhaps the biggest surprise. The secret, I believe, is a stunning, mature, intelligent script.

Fortunately, Christian Bale's Batman is almost a supporting character. Bale is good, but there is something around his mouth that stops him from being great. "The Dark Knight" is visually stunning, powerful, and moving. What else could anyone want.

The Dark Knight is one of the best movies I have ever seen.

I'm just gonna start off by saying I LOVE this movie. It's one of my favorites of all time. I honestly can't think of too much wrong with this movie other than it's a little long and Batman's by now infamous voice. But everything else is top-notch. The acting, story, atmosphere, and action scenes are all amazing. If you haven't seen this movie, see it right now! I went into this not expecting too much, but I came out blown away. I can't imagine any movie being much better. I'll just have to wait for The Dark Knight Rises to release to see if anything can be better. Until then, this stands as the best movie I've ever seen.

 Ledger's performance is Oscar-worthy.

"The soundtrack feels like an afterthought, adding little to the overall viewing experience."

The film is dark and intense, not suitable for children.
"This is a very fine movie; go see it."
What can I say that hasn't been said before? Not much. It's the story, the acting, the premise, but most of all, this movie is about how it makes you feel.

This film was well hyped when it first came out and got plenty of good publicity through Smith's song of the same name. However it always felt like a film that was gearing itself up for a sequel rather than a film in itself. The story is in two strands - the first is J's fish out of water act and the second is the search for the universe. These two interlink as the main body is the attempt to stop the bug, but the funniest moments involve J being overwhelmed by the tings around him - in this setting he is the most accessible character to the audience as we are experiencing the same as him. The plot is a little daft but it's all delivered with tongue in cheek and has enough laughs to keep us amused.
Just watched Joker in 2019, I just have to come back and give Dark Knight a 10. And thanks to Heath Ledger for the exceptional performance.

"The film's resolution is too neat, resolving conflicts in a way that feels overly convenient."
"A triumph of storytelling that seamlessly weaves together multiple narratives into a cohesive and impactful whole."
