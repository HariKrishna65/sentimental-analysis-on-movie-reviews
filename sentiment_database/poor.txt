The first half of Brahmotsavam starts with the narration of a beautiful family filled with emotional people all over. As time passes on, the movie dips down completely as it lacks the much needed bonding and relations between them. The songs have been showcased in a hurry and most of the songs come during the first half an hour of the film. The interval episodes have been predictable and the first half ends on a OK note. The second half of Brahmotsavam doesn't have the needed content because of which the film drops down completely. The emotional episodes look faked completely and the entire second half tests the audience's patience. The climax has been decent but it will not make much impact on the audience.

Brahmotsavam is a story of a family and one member of the family in particular. That person is Mahesh Babu's character. Curiously, most of the characters in the film don't have a name, Mahesh being one of them. He is a son of a wealthy paint businessman who has made an empire out of nothing. His father, played by Sathyaraj, has a confidante and a brother of sorts who handles everything for him, played by Rao Ramesh. Ramesh was always jealous of the status, wealth and respect Sathyaraj held and wanted the same for himself. Also, he is anxious to get his daughter Pranitha Subhash married to Mahesh. In the end Brahmotsavam is strictly a one time watch and mostly for Mahesh Babu fans. It is a decent ride that will leave you a little unsatisfied towards the end. But kudos to Srikanth Addala for trying to do something different.

Absolutely brilliant. Mahesh babu showing why he's one of the finest actors in India. Top notch direction and brilliant performances. Climax will definitely leave you in tears. The movie is brilliantly captured. Locations look phenomenal. Should go on to become the biggest hit of mahesh's career. Mahesh babu just keeps getting younger with every movie. This is a film which will appeal to all sections and ages. This film will make you want to call each and every family member of yours and talk to them. The songs are very peppy and the sets are brilliant. First half as good as second half. Don't go expecting a mass movie with just fights and slap stick comedy and you will not be disappointed.

"The package in which this fascinating and timely content comes wrapped is disappointingly generic."
The same tired old gags modernized for the extreme sports generation. There's already been too many of these films.
Absolutely brilliant. Mahesh babu showing why he's one of the finest actors in India. Top notch direction and brilliant performances. Climax will definitely leave you in tears. The movie is brilliantly captured. Locations look phenomenal. Should go on to become the biggest hit of mahesh's career. Mahesh babu just keeps getting younger with every movie. This is a film which will appeal to all sections and ages. This film will make you want to call each and every family member of yours and talk to them. The songs are very peppy and the sets are brilliant. First half as good as second half. Don't go expecting a mass movie with just fights and slap stick comedy and you will not be disappointed.

No wait a min, the climax is still going on, the family's getting united, Rao Ramesh is still confessing, Ppl around him are praising Mahesh, the aunts are still crying, there's already a pool of tears on the floor etc etc. Admist all this hungama, MB's act stands out. If not for him, PVP wouldn't even have recovered 10% of his total expenditure. Dialogues take a little time to understand. You need to be attentive. The screenplay bores you, but the dialogues seek your attention. That's like revenge on the audience.

"Brahmotsavam" is about a family comprising a brother (Satyaraj) and his six sisters in Vijayawada and these members are separated, due to some reasons. the brother's son Ajay (Mahesh Babu) sets out to reunite them. How he does it with the help of his sisters-in-law, played by Samantha, Kajal Aggarwal and Pranitha forms the crux of the story. only some scenes in the first half and Mahesh Prescence leads the movie and 2 stars for these. there is nothing in the movie. but if u go with your family. the movie will be worth watching. but for students and couples i recommend not to go. OVERALL ITS NOT A COMPLETE FAMILY ENTERTAINER. BUT IT HAS A MESSAGE THAT WORTH WAITING TILL THE END. FINALLY COMPARED TO SRIMANTHUDU THIS MOVIE IS A HEADACHE. I SUGGEST NOT TO WATCH. ITS WORTH WATCHING IN A TV BROADCAST. :D #BrahmostavamBegins
"Aside from showing us in explicit detail how difficult it is to win over the two-drink-minimum crowd, there's little to be learned from watching 'Comedian.'"
"The best thing that can be said of the picture is that it does have a few cute moments."
All the actors share the screen play quite proportionately, and this is a great feat the director has achieved. Mahesh conveys all emotions so perfectly. Samantha looks gorgeous. Kajal does portrays her character well. Pranitha hasn't much to do, except accept the way things are. The camera work is top-notch, and the cinematography is breath-taking. It's a movie with an unorthodox plot, unorthodox screenplay and everything about is so refreshing if not new. The dialogues are written after a good thought, and fit in the context and feel good. The songs are short and soothing, and adopted in a way which is very unusual for Telugu audience in the recent times. Overall it is a must watch movie, which takes you on a journey with a wide range of emotions.

"Hip-hop prison thriller of stupefying absurdity."

Long long ago, when NTR and ANR enacted in multi starrers it was a feast for the eyes. When that trend bogged down, it was Srikanth Addala who revamped with his cult classic SVSC. Addala's journey so far has been a memorable one in the world of telugu cinema. The subjects he chose; the way he had woven story lines intertwined with emotions was gaily applauded. MB got the much needed kick from his last enterprise Srimanthudu. He wanted more, like the cola ad, so chose Brahmotsavam to woo the family audience again.

Absolutely brilliant. Mahesh babu showing why he's one of the finest actors in India. Top notch direction and brilliant performances. Climax will definitely leave you in tears. The movie is brilliantly captured. Locations look phenomenal. Should go on to become the biggest hit of mahesh's career. Mahesh babu just keeps getting younger with every movie. This is a film which will appeal to all sections and ages. This film will make you want to call each and every family member of yours and talk to them. The songs are very peppy and the sets are brilliant. First half as good as second half. Don't go expecting a mass movie with just fights and slap stick comedy and you will not be disappointed.
"I felt trapped and with no obvious escape for the entire 100 minutes."
After murari this many people on the big screen. This movie shows how the joint families life in India. People who expects punch dialogs,comedy & mass fighting this is not the movie for those. I like the directors thought and honor for his thought to find and meet the 7 generations people. I like the story and all the actors performed their best in the roles. Specially mahesh sir, kajol and ramesh garu lived in their roles. The affection between father and son , some good words deliver to the small girl who is about to die. Rao gopal rao cartoon is good.costumes and visualization is awesome. Only one thing i doesn't like is misplacement of songs.otherwise i could have give 10/10.

average 1st half,below average 2nd half. congrats #Brahmotsavam Few of the scenes were copied from Venkatesh movies. Untiming songs, Interval with heavy dose of sentiment, Less commercial elements, Poor comedy,No high Point in the story.#brahmotsavam Kajal, Pranitha and now Samantha wooing Mahesh Unbalanced emotions in 2nd half 90's kind of Venkatesh films. Svsc mark first half.. but this time it revolves around a rich family background. father character is big change. Interval 10 Min's...Climax 15 Min's performances excluding these scenes rest all are Addala's worst comparison. Slow placed and too many songs. Interval is awesome and very emotional."Brahmotsavam" has a tried-and-tested story that has been seen in Telugu films several times, but Srikanth Addala's treatment of the subject has made it a perfect family entertainer. Some romantic, comedy and sentimental scenes keep the viewers entertained throughout the movie, but the slow and dragging narration plays spoilsports.

Mahesh Babu's thinking behind sharing the production of the movie makes me seriously question his rationale for choice and his decision making. I am just not OK that an actor of his caliber misused. Also, a comedian of great potential like Vennela Kishore was also not used rightly. Perhaps, he is the only actor in the whole film who brought a smile sporadically.

By watching this movie I came to know that how editing and screenplay are important in a movie.The worst screenplay and editing. U will come out of the theater after watching half an hour maximum.In the first half very irrelevant songs.Dance by Mahesh Babu in one song is very funny.His reputation gets down after watching that song. Srikanth Addala would have concentrated only in direction department instead of screenplay,editing and dialogues.The duration of the film is too long.We will think that when will the movie finishes.Rao Gopal Rao voice in cartoon will be boring.

But kudos to Srikanth Addala for trying to do something different.
This film takes a fascinating historical event and manages to drain it of all excitement, tension, and meaning.

First of all I am not a fan of MaheshBabu, But I am a fan of his Movie scripts which is more Socially relatable ones except some pathetic entertainment Movies which all other actors will do for their Lifetime.

average 1st half,below average 2nd half. congrats #Brahmotsavam Few of the scenes were copied from Venkatesh movies. Untiming songs, Interval with heavy dose of sentiment, Less commercial elements, Poor comedy,No high Point in the story.#brahmotsavam Kajal, Pranitha and now Samantha wooing Mahesh Unbalanced emotions in 2nd half 90's kind of Venkatesh films. Svsc mark first half.. but this time it revolves around a rich family background. father character is big change. Interval 10 Min's...Climax 15 Min's performances excluding these scenes rest all are Addala's worst comparison. Slow placed and too many songs. Interval is awesome and very emotional."Brahmotsavam" has a tried-and-tested story that has been seen in Telugu films several times, but Srikanth Addala's treatment of the subject has made it a perfect family entertainer. Some romantic, comedy and sentimental scenes keep the viewers entertained throughout the movie, but the slow and dragging narration plays spoilsports.

"Brahmotsavam" is about a family comprising a brother (Satyaraj) and his six sisters in Vijayawada and these members are separated, due to some reasons. the brother's son Ajay (Mahesh Babu) sets out to reunite them. How he does it with the help of his sisters-in-law, played by Samantha, Kajal Aggarwal and Pranitha forms the crux of the story. only some scenes in the first half and Mahesh Prescence leads the movie and 2 stars for these. there is nothing in the movie. but if u go with your family. the movie will be worth watching. but for students and couples i recommend not to go. OVERALL ITS NOT A COMPLETE FAMILY ENTERTAINER. BUT IT HAS A MESSAGE THAT WORTH WAITING TILL THE END. FINALLY COMPARED TO SRIMANTHUDU THIS MOVIE IS A HEADACHE. I SUGGEST NOT TO WATCH. ITS WORTH WATCHING IN A TV BROADCAST. :D #BrahmostavamBegins
"The film's pacing is uneven, leading to moments of disinterest and a lack of emotional engagement."
By watching this movie I came to know that how editing and screenplay are important in a movie.The worst screenplay and editing. U will come out of the theater after watching half an hour maximum.In the first half very irrelevant songs.Dance by Mahesh Babu in one song is very funny.His reputation gets down after watching that song. Srikanth Addala would have concentrated only in direction department instead of screenplay,editing and dialogues.The duration of the film is too long.We will think that when will the movie finishes.Rao Gopal Rao voice in cartoon will be boring. I suggest you not to watch this movie and waste your time.There is no proper characterization.Kajol will come and go.Samantha will come to Mahesh Babu's saying that she is Mahesh's sister's friend and stays in his home.Very funny.
How this one escaped the Lifetime Network, I'll never know.
Quite frankly, I can't see why any actor of talent would ever work in a McCulloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out.

"4ever has the same sledgehammer appeal as Pokemon videos but it breathes more on the big screen and induces headaches more slowly."
"The film's climax is anticlimactic, leaving the audience with a sense of disappointment."
As the name suggests this movie goes with perception of a protagonist named Ajay. A boy who love Simplicity,Wonders,Principles,Life and much more. The story starts with our root concept vasudhaiva kutumbakam where in joint family happiness and that subtle part of the joint family. The way they have shown our culture in this movie is more than festival celebrations. The concept of bringing Supreme lord vishnu and Lakshmi devi talk in every aspect of life is outstanding. Ajay going to different parts of India to know about himself and to find the root of his family is another message where in this modern society people are more towards the fashionable modernity where they are not remembering their own clan. Ajay is such a character where he has everything that he wished for but he finds his happiness in his family bringing togetherness and if you observe this movie is filled with lot of philosophical messages which is an added pro. Title track Is best in the movie where it implies to know who you really are. Audience who didn't like this movie is the one who lost it. This movie needs greater attention audience should give more attention towards the subtle parts in the movie rather than making it as mess while watching. Each and every scene is relatable to life except some filmy love scenes. Mahesh a superstar himself made this movie just because of the simpleness in the script and to admire our culture. This shows that Mahesh is more towards scripts than illogical 3rd class actions. Movie may have been flop but mahesh gave exceptional gem after the Cult Classic movie Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu.

"All the movie's narrative gymnastics can't disguise the fact that it's inauthentic at its core and that its story just isn't worth telling."
"The film's reliance on generic action tropes hinders its ability to distinguish itself in a crowded genre."
This film is a masterclass in how not to handle sensitive subject matter, trivializing serious issues for cheap laughs.
"bright well-acted and thought-provoking Tuck Everlasting suffers from a laconic pace and a lack of traditional action"
"this misty-eyed southern nostalgia piece in treading the line between sappy and sanguine winds up mired in teardrenched quicksand"

"laughable dialogue"
Long long ago, when NTR and ANR enacted in multi starrers it was a feast for the eyes. When that trend bogged down, it was Srikanth Addala who revamped with his cult classic SVSC. Addala's journey so far has been a memorable one in the world of telugu cinema. The subjects he chose; the way he had woven story lines intertwined with emotions was gaily applauded. MB got the much needed kick from his last enterprise Srimanthudu. He wanted more, like the cola ad, so chose Brahmotsavam to woo the family audience again.

Coming to the artistes, (yeah there were scores of them), Rao Ramesh bagged yet another classy role. He's filling in his dad's shoes very well. Addala always has a special role for him in his heart and in his movies. Revathi, Jayasudha and Satya raj put in a decent act. The others are just wasted. Naresh, Siyaji Shinde, Tulasi etc hardly have couple of dialogues to mouth. Vennela Kishore manages to evoke few laughs, he is shown to be in total sync with the current audience mindset. All the 3 damsels were cute.Romance between Kajal and MB got monotonous after few episodes. Chemistry between Sam and MB was more bewitching. Pranitha - oh yeah, she was there too, just there. Mickey's music was ok but BGM was much better. Too many songs spoiled the movie's broth

As the name suggests this movie goes with perception of a protagonist named Ajay. A boy who love Simplicity,Wonders,Principles,Life and much more. The story starts with our root concept vasudhaiva kutumbakam where in joint family happiness and that subtle part of the joint family. The way they have shown our culture in this movie is more than festival celebrations. The concept of bringing Supreme lord vishnu and Lakshmi devi talk in every aspect of life is outstanding. Ajay going to different parts of India to know about himself and to find the root of his family is another message where in this modern society people are more towards the fashionable modernity where they are not remembering their own clan. Ajay is such a character where he has everything that he wished for but he finds his happiness in his family bringing togetherness and if you observe this movie is filled with lot of philosophical messages which is an added pro. Title track Is best in the movie where it implies to know who you really are. Audience who didn't like this movie is the one who lost it. This movie needs greater attention audience should give more attention towards the subtle parts in the movie rather than making it as mess while watching. Each and every scene is relatable to life except some filmy love scenes. Mahesh a superstar himself made this movie just because of the simpleness in the script and to admire our culture. This shows that Mahesh is more towards scripts than illogical 3rd class actions.

The movie snail paces towards the climax. Did the end credits roll? No wait a min, the climax is still going on, the family's getting united, Rao Ramesh is still confessing, Ppl around him are praising Mahesh, the aunts are still crying, there's already a pool of tears on the floor etc etc. Admist all this hungama, MB's act stands out. If not for him, PVP wouldn't even have recovered 10% of his total expenditure. Dialogues take a little time to understand. You need to be attentive. The screenplay bores you, but the dialogues seek your attention. That's like revenge on the audience.

If you are a person from the joint family, take my word that the movie is simply superb. First half was the mentioning of theme and the second was the explanation of the theme. The people who thought that the movie has created the headache are those who gives no value to the affections. The way of showing the relational values in India is at its best. Of course, every movie possesses some negatives. But Director Srikanth wrote some marvelous conversations in the movie and also some of the moments in the movie are the real life experiences in the joint family. On watching the 2nd half, i just got tears. Climax was excellent. And obviously, Mahesh was amazing and acted brilliantly again. The movie will draw the attention of our parent's generation for sure. we have seen lot of feel good movies in the concepts of Love. But here comes the Feel good family entertainer. On the whole, Movie is above average for me.

All the actors share the screen play quite proportionately, and this is a great feat the director has achieved. Mahesh conveys all emotions so perfectly. Samantha looks gorgeous. Kajal does portrays her character well. Pranitha hasn't much to do, except accept the way things are. The camera work is top-notch, and the cinematography is breath-taking. It's a movie with an unorthodox plot, unorthodox screenplay and everything about is so refreshing if not new. The dialogues are written after a good thought, and fit in the context and feel good. The songs are short and soothing, and adopted in a way which is very unusual for Telugu audience in the recent times. Overall it is a must watch movie, which takes you on a journey with a wide range of emotions.

Mukunda, SVSC, Kotta Bangaru Lokam were a true testament of Addala's potential. He had the niche for portraying human emotions beautifully on the silver screen. Even though Mukunda bombed it was a decent watch. But Brahmotsavam ends up as a total bummer. Addala couldn't weave his band and re-create his magic, MB couldn't save the movie from sinking deep into the flop bed of telugu cinema and Audience couldn't help zandu-balming themselves.

"The film's soundtrack fails to leave a lasting impression, missing opportunities to enhance key moments."
Worst thing about the movie was screenplay.
Mahesh Babu's thinking behind sharing the production of the movie makes me seriously question his rationale for choice and his decision making. I am just not OK that an actor of his caliber misused. Also, a comedian of great potential like Vennela Kishore was also not used rightly. Perhaps, he is the only actor in the whole film who brought a smile sporadically. Rao Ramesh emoted well, although purposelessly. Indeed, Rao Ramesh character is the only one I empathized.

If you are a person from the joint family, take my word that the movie is simply superb. First half was the mentioning of theme and the second was the explanation of the theme. The people who thought that the movie has created the headache are those who gives no value to the affections. The way of showing the relational values in India is at its best. Of course, every movie possesses some negatives. But Director Srikanth wrote some marvelous conversations in the movie and also some of the moments in the movie are the real life experiences in the joint family. On watching the 2nd half, i just got tears. Climax was excellent. And obviously, Mahesh was amazing and acted brilliantly again. The movie will draw the attention of our parent's generation for sure. we have seen lot of feel good movies in the concepts of Love. But here comes the Feel good family entertainer. On the whole, Movie is above average for me.

Mukunda, SVSC, Kotta Bangaru Lokam were a true testament of Addala's potential. He had the niche for portraying human emotions beautifully on the silver screen. Even though Mukunda bombed it was a decent watch. But Brahmotsavam ends up as a total bummer.

Long long ago, when NTR and ANR enacted in multi starrers it was a feast for the eyes. When that trend bogged down, it was Srikanth Addala who revamped with his cult classic SVSC. Addala's journey so far has been a memorable one in the world of telugu cinema. The subjects he chose; the way he had woven story lines intertwined with emotions was gaily applauded. MB got the much needed kick from his last enterprise Srimanthudu. He wanted more, like the cola ad, so chose Brahmotsavam to woo the family audience again.

Coming to the artistes, (yeah there were scores of them), Rao Ramesh bagged yet another classy role. He's filling in his dad's shoes very well. Addala always has a special role for him in his heart and in his movies. Revathi, Jayasudha and Satya raj put in a decent act. The others are just wasted. Naresh, Siyaji Shinde, Tulasi etc hardly have couple of dialogues to mouth. Vennela Kishore manages to evoke few laughs, he is shown to be in total sync with the current audience mindset. All the 3 damsels were cute.Romance between Kajal and MB got monotonous after few episodes. Chemistry between Sam and MB was more bewitching. Pranitha - oh yeah, she was there too, just there. Mickey's music was ok but BGM was much better. Too many songs spoiled the movie's broth

"Brahmotsavam" is about a family comprising a brother (Satyaraj) and his six sisters in Vijayawada and these members are separated, due to some reasons. the brother's son Ajay (Mahesh Babu) sets out to reunite them. How he does it with the help of his sisters-in-law, played by Samantha, Kajal Aggarwal and Pranitha forms the crux of the story. only some scenes in the first half and Mahesh Prescence leads the movie and 2 stars for these. there is nothing in the movie. but if u go with your family. the movie will be worth watching. but for students and couples i recommend not to go. OVERALL ITS NOT A COMPLETE FAMILY ENTERTAINER. BUT IT HAS A MESSAGE THAT WORTH WAITING TILL THE END. FINALLY COMPARED TO SRIMANTHUDU THIS MOVIE IS A HEADACHE. I SUGGEST NOT TO WATCH. ITS WORTH WATCHING IN A TV BROADCAST. :D #BrahmostavamBegins

After murari this many people on the big screen. This movie shows how the joint families life in India. People who expects punch dialogs,comedy & mass fighting this is not the movie for those. I like the directors thought and honor for his thought to find and meet the 7 generations people. I like the story and all the actors performed their best in the roles. Specially mahesh sir, kajol and ramesh garu lived in their roles. The affection between father and son , some good words deliver to the small girl who is about to die. Rao gopal rao cartoon is good.costumes and visualization is awesome. Only one thing i doesn't like is misplacement of songs.otherwise i could have give 10/10.

Movie lacks a direction, I couldn't see what the movie was about even 1 hr into it. The scenes were disjoint. There are a lot of talented actors but no character development. JayPrakash Reddy, Jayasudha, Naresh, Revati and most of the character artistes were wasted. Samantha should go back to acting school. Bad use of animation (Rao Ramesh's inner voice).

"A well-made but emotionally scattered film whose hero gives his heart only to the dog."
Mahesh Babu's thinking behind sharing the production of the movie makes me seriously question his rationale for choice and his decision making. I am just not OK that an actor of his caliber misused. Also, a comedian of great potential like Vennela Kishore was also not used rightly. Perhaps, he is the only actor in the whole film who brought a smile sporadically. Rao Ramesh emoted well, although purposelessly. Indeed, Rao Ramesh character is the only one I empathized.

average 1st half,below average 2nd half. congrats #Brahmotsavam Few of the scenes were copied from Venkatesh movies. Untiming songs, Interval with heavy dose of sentiment, Less commercial elements, Poor comedy,No high Point in the story.#brahmotsavam Kajal, Pranitha and now Samantha wooing Mahesh Unbalanced emotions in 2nd half 90's kind of Venkatesh films. Svsc mark first half.. but this time it revolves around a rich family background. father character is big change. Interval 10 Min's...Climax 15 Min's performances excluding these scenes rest all are Addala's worst comparison. Slow placed and too many songs. Interval is awesome and very emotional."Brahmotsavam" has a tried-and-tested story that has been seen in Telugu films several times, but Srikanth Addala's treatment of the subject has made it a perfect family entertainer. Some romantic, comedy and sentimental scenes keep the viewers entertained throughout the movie, but the slow and dragging narration plays spoilsports.

The first half of Brahmotsavam starts with the narration of a beautiful family filled with emotional people all over. As time passes on, the movie dips down completely as it lacks the much needed bonding and relations between them. The songs have been showcased in a hurry and most of the songs come during the first half an hour of the film. The interval episodes have been predictable and the first half ends on a OK note. The second half of Brahmotsavam doesn't have the needed content because of which the film drops down completely. The emotional episodes look faked completely and the entire second half tests the audience's patience. The climax has been decent but it will not make much impact on the audience.

Coming to the artistes, (yeah there were scores of them), Rao Ramesh bagged yet another classy role. He's filling in his dad's shoes very well. Addala always has a special role for him in his heart and in his movies. Revathi, Jayasudha and Satya raj put in a decent act. The others are just wasted. Naresh, Siyaji Shinde, Tulasi etc hardly have couple of dialogues to mouth. Vennela Kishore manages to evoke few laughs, he is shown to be in total sync with the current audience mindset. All the 3 damsels were cute.Romance between Kajal and MB got monotonous after few episodes. Chemistry between Sam and MB was more bewitching. Pranitha - oh yeah, she was there too, just there. Mickey's music was ok but BGM was much better. Too many songs spoiled the movie's broth

Even though Mukunda bombed it was a decent watch. But Brahmotsavam ends up as a total bummer. Addala couldn't weave his band and re-create his magic, MB couldn't save the movie from sinking deep into the flop bed of telugu cinema and Audience couldn't help zandu-balming themselves.
